<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Diane Kaye D. Ancheta, 19 years old. I am currently studying at Kings College of the Philippines-Pico, Benguet. I am taking Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>

<p>Studying Information Technology has been an exciting and challenging journey for me. From the very beginning, 
  I’ve been fascinated by how technology connects everything in our world. I’ve learned so much about coding, networks, 
  and systems, and it's been amazing to see how everything works together. I enjoy problem-solving, and IT offers me endless 
  opportunities to tackle complex challenges. Every class I take feels like a step closer to understanding how technology shapes
  our lives. It’s not always easy, but the satisfaction of figuring things out and knowing that I’m gaining skills for the future 
  makes it all worthwhile. I’m eager to see where this knowledge takes me and how I can apply it to make an impact.</p>
